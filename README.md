# Description

This project was made for the Nebraska FBLA SLC 2021-2022 Coding and Programming event. 
The main purpose of the program is to provide the user with possible places to visit based on six criteria: city, state, cost, type, indoor/outdoor, rating (based on Google Reviews)
Based on the user's input, we will recommend as many locations as possible and will include necessary information about each. User don't have to input all criteria, but have the option to

We used the library tKinter for the app window
We used the programming language Python for our code and developed it in VSCode

Some challenges we faced were:
  How to input the attractions into a list
  Search through the list if the user didn't input all the info
  Show the cities within each of the states based on the original user input of state
  
Features we hope to implement in the future:
  A link to the websites so users can have more information
  A map feature allowing users to narrow in what they want
  
# Instructions

Open the app

Input your wanted criteria and then click submit.
  State, city, type are dropdowns
  Cost is a drag (top bar is min price, middle bar is max price)
  Required rating is the bottomest drag bar (0-5)
  
Next, click search to view attractions and decide which one is best for you!
