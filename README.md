# Description

This project was made for the Nebraska FBLA SLC 2021-2022 Coding and Programming event. 
The main purpose of the program is to provide the user with possible places to visit based on six criteria: city, state, cost, type, indoor/outdoor, rating (based on Google Reviews)
Based on the user's input, we will recommend as many locations as possible and will include necessary information about each. User don't have to input all criteria, but have the option to

We used the library tKinter for the app window
We used the programming language Python for our code and developed it in VSCode

Some challenges we faced were:

  How to input the attractions into a list, 
  Search through the list if the user didn't input all the info, 
  Show the cities within each of the states based on the original user input of state, 
  
Features we hope to implement in the future:
  A link to the websites so users can have more information, 
  A map feature allowing users to narrow in what they want
  
# Instructions

1. Enter your desired criteria. The top dropdown decides the state, the second dropdown decides the city, and the third dropdown decides the top of attraction. The check mark indicates whether the attraction is indoor (checked) or outdoors (unchecked). The next slider is the maximum price and the bottommost slider is the minimum rating. Once finished entered, click the search button.

2. Use the back and next button to toggle through the attractions. At the bottom of the screen, you can see how many attractions match your criteria.

3. Enjoy the attraction you choose!
